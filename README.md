Hi, I'm Marino Guerieri, a web developer and this is my personal website based on [Gatsby + Netlify CMS starter template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms).

You're free to use it any way you want, even use it as you're own personal site - it's all right with me as long as you don't take credit for my projects. :-D
